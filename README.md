INTRODUCTION OF PROJECT:
We know that modern people are very busy. In this busy world every individual want to show their efficiency by saving their time and competing with others. Since this is a century of IT, each and every organization wants to bring changes in their traditional system and apply the modern techniques.
                           For the development in the field of education many educational institutes, schools, colleges have been established. These organizations need to keep each and every records of their student’s information. This record keeping system can be equally kept manually but to compete in this rapidly developing world, the use of computer software for the same task is more efficient, effective and convenient. Thus we attempt to develop this project and named it “STUDENT DATA ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM”. We are developing this project for “Crimson College of technology”.















SCOPE OF PROJECT:
As our software is related to students, so it will be used in each and every educational institutes such as languages  institutes, computer institutes, coaching centres, colleges, schoolsetc. that can  implement the software to computerize their record keeping system. There are different updates that can be done with students account datum such as edit, delete, add etc. 
In addition to educational institutes the other organizations can also implement the software by little modifications in the coding for specifying the information requirements according to their development.


















Project features:
 In this project we as a team aimed to design and develop software named "Student data account management system" for 'Crimson College of technology'. It will help in performing various activities concerning data managementof using computer system. 
	It keeps the record of each and every student regarding different faculties.
	It keeps a list of students’ fee.
	We can easily add data of students.
	We can easily search the data of students.
	We can erase the data of students if not necessary.
	We can easily manage the fee structure of the students of different faculty.

















Tools used:
1)	Hardware
•	 Monitor
•	Hard disk 500 GB
•	Pen drive 8 GB
•	Printer
•	Ram 4 GB
2)	Software
•	Microsoft word
•	Window operating system
•	Vb. Net for front end
•	SQL server for back end















Technical challenges:

1. Viruses may affect the system so proper anti-virus program must be installed in to the computer.
2.  As our project is in vb.net that requires windows platform so, all types of computer devices cannot support this platform properly.
3. Problem of power supply can occur anytime at the moment of developing software so backup devices need to be purchased.
4. The logical database model should respond to the given task and cover the basic requirements.


















BUDGET ESTIMATION:
The budgeting is also one of the implemented factors of this project. The estimated budget for this project is:

Methodology:
As mentioned above we will use waterfall model to develop this project. This model consists the following phases:

PROJECT DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE

I.	Requirement analysis:
Refines project goals into the define function and operation of the intended application. Analysis user information needs.

II.	System design:
Describe desired features and operation in detail, including screen layouts, business rules, process diagrams and other documentation.

III.	Coding & implementation:
Now it’s time to add code without disturbing the design part. We started coding considering the interface and the code should not disturb the look. The interaction is done in order to understand the design. Necessary testing plans as well as technical documentation are generated.

IV.	Testing :
Bring all the pieces together into a special testing environment then checks for                                           errors, bugs and interoperability.

V.	Maintenance:
After continuous review of error and fixing them continuously certain time arise when software is obsolete. Software development life cycle demand maintains and update in certain period of time.
